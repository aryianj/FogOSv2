---- FogOSv2 Birthday, Date, Time Help Guide ----

-- Birthday --
birthday | birthday with no flags. If the birthday is set, then it will tell the user "happy 
happy", otherwise it will tell the user not yet!
birthday '-s' [MM/DD] | birthday with -s flag will set the birthday. Must be in MM/DD format
where both are integers.

-- Date --
date | only command for date. This will return the date in format: MMM DD HH:MM:SS PDT YYYY
Note: MMM is a string. The rest are integers besides PDT.

-- Time --
time.c and time.h are required for date and time to work. Time is not a usable command.
